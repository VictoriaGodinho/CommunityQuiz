Project Overview

Mindfulness & Stress Check-In for Students is an interactive web application designed to help students assess their mental well-being and provide personalized relaxation techniques based on their mood, sleep quality, energy levels, and stress triggers. The project includes engaging background animations that respond to user inputs, creating an immersive experience while encouraging self-care practices.

Design Process

1. Research and Understanding the Problem
The idea for this project stemmed from the growing awareness of stress and mental health issues among college students. I wanted to create a tool that not only checks in on a student's emotional and physical state but also provides useful and easy-to-implement suggestions for managing stress. The application aims to be approachable, fun, and interactive while helping students reflect on their current well-being.
2. User Experience and Flow
The design process began by mapping out a simple, user-friendly flow:
Index Page: A mood-based survey where students can select their current emotional state.
Sleep Page: A page that asks students about their sleep habits and energy levels.
Stress Page: A form that allows users to identify stress triggers and coping mechanisms.
Results Page: Displays personalized results with recommendations based on the previous selections.
Each page features interactive elements such as sliders, radio buttons, and dynamic background animations, which change based on user input.
3. Inspiration
I was inspired by various wellness and self-care apps that emphasize personal reflection and mindfulness practices. I wanted to integrate a sense of calm and positivity into the design, with the dynamic backgrounds representing different emotional states. For example, the happy mood uses a gradient with bright, uplifting colors, while the stressed mood has darker, intense tones.
Additionally, the background animations, which respond to user input (like the energy slider or mood selection), are inspired by the idea of "flowing energy" or emotional shifts. This gives the app an engaging, playful feel while staying aligned with the theme of mindfulness.
4. Visual Design and Layout
I wanted the visual elements to be simple but impactful. The UI design includes clear, readable fonts and minimalistic button designs. The focus is on the experience, with clean and well-spaced forms. Each page’s background and animations are a key part of communicating the app’s theme and user mood.

Challenges Faced

1. Animating Backgrounds
One of the main challenges was creating smooth, responsive background animations that shifted based on user inputs. Implementing CSS animations for dynamic background gradients proved tricky at first, as it required precise timing and adjustments to ensure the transitions looked natural.
